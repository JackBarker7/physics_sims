# A simulation of the motion of a rocket launched from the Earth due to the Earth and Moon

This program simulates the position of a rocket launched from the Earth. Both the cases of a stationary moon (`moon_pos_1`) and an orbiting moon (`moon_pos_2`) are considered. The program uses the Improved Euler Method to simulate the motion
