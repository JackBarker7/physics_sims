# Simulates Double and multiple slit diffraction patterns

Uses Huygens' principle (by considering each slit as many point sources) to calculate the diffraction pattern due to a set of slits.

The interference of waves from each source are considered at an array of points comprising the screen. The program outputs the diffraction pattern
